![alt text](https://github.com/Rickerp/IST-CG-P1/blob/master/assets/summary_image.png)  
We were asked to do a representation of this image in ![three.js](https://threejs.org/) with the following actions  
* Define three cameras upper (**1**), side (**2**) and front (**3**) view of the scene. Change between cameras using keys **1** to **3**  
* Use key **4** to turn on/off wireframe of objects  
* Use **arrow** keys to move the robot  
* Use **A** and **S** to change θ1 angle, **Q** and **W** to change θ2 (θ3 is a fixed 90º angle)
